# Uncommon Elixir Error: Improper Use of throw in Enum.reduce

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Elixir related to the improper use of the `throw` function within `Enum.reduce`.  While `throw` can be used, it's generally recommended to favor more structured error handling mechanisms like `try-catch` for better code readability and maintainability.

The `bug.ex` file shows the problematic code, which uses `throw` to halt the `Enum.reduce` process when a specific condition is met. This approach can lead to less predictable behavior and makes error handling less explicit.

The `bugSolution.ex` file provides a revised version that addresses this issue by employing a `try-catch` block. This approach offers improved error handling, allowing the code to gracefully handle the error condition and return a meaningful result or take alternative actions.
